# Claude Code Runners: Project Memory

This document serves as the shared memory and guiding principles for the AI agent team working on this project. All agents MUST adhere to the standards outlined here.

## 1. Project Goal

- **High-Level Objective:** To build [brief description of the project, e.g., a web application for task management].
- **Target User:** [e.g., Busy professionals, students].
- **Core Value Proposition:** [e.g., To provide a simple, intuitive way to manage daily tasks and improve productivity].

## 2. Technical Principles

- **Technology Stack:**
  - **Frontend:** [e.g., React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS]
  - **Backend:** [e.g., Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM]
  - **Database:** [e.g., PostgreSQL]
  - **Deployment:** [e.g., Docker, AWS ECS]
- **Code Style:** All code MUST adhere to the Prettier configuration in the repository. All JavaScript/TypeScript code must pass ESLint checks.
- **Testing:** All new business logic MUST be accompanied by unit tests. New API endpoints MUST have integration tests. A test-driven development (TDD) approach is preferred.

## 3. Communication Protocol

- **Artifacts:** All documents generated by agents (PRDs, TDDs, etc.) MUST be placed in a `/docs` subdirectory and named according to the convention `[type]-[feature-slug].md`.
- **Status:** The `orchestrator.py` script is the single source of truth for task status. Do not manually edit `plan.yml`.

This memory file can be updated by the `project-planner` or other designated agents as the project evolves.
